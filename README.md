## Description

This is a hangman project developed using mainly Python. It aims to be fully usable with condition statement and bug free! From this project I've learned to make use of OOP in Python, and revised my memory on some coding basics.

## Installation Guide

To install this project, it's required to install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Usage Guide

1. Open the Terminal on your machine and type `python milestone_2.py`.
2. The program will then randomly choose a word, giving the user a prompt to guess a letter from the randomly chosen word.
3. Keep guessing the letters until the word has been revealed to you.
4. The program will output the message whether you've lost or won the game.
